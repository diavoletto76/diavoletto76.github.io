## Learning computer science the hard way

I'm missing the good old days when I used to be a web developer. In my spare time, I keep fit studying programming languages (mostly *functional* ones) and new tools. I love [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). I like experimenting with different technologies such as:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org)
- [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
- HTML
- CSS

My preferred learning platform is [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): it's full of exercises in different programming languages.
