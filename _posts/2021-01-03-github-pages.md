Guess what? You can use GitHub Pages to host your personal or a project site.

The idea is very simple! Given an existing repository, under *Settings/GitHub Pages* choose **branch** and **folder** from which GitHub will publish your pages. You can provide simple **markdown** files and GitHub will take care of needed conversion.
